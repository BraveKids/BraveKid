**The Trial** is a 2D puzzle platform developed for the Global Game Jam 2016 in Milan.
The main theme is ritual, so our idea is based on the **RITE of PASSAGE**.
Generally speaking, a rite of passage is a ritual that marks the change of an individual from one status to another.
It is divided into three fundamental stages:
 1. Separation
 2. Transition
 3. Reinstatement

The Trial tells the story of a child facing a growing process passing through the stages mentioned before.
Each stage corresponds to the level, where the child discovers parts of himself that he didn't know before.
In each level there are challenges of difficulty equal to the knowledge that the character has of himself, so the degree of challenge will grow hand in hand to the maturity of the protagonist.

The rite of passage that we will use is a test of courage among kids of a neighborhood.
The protagonist will face a series of tests that will allow him to be recognized by the group from which he was excluded.
Among the many vicissitudes that the protagonist will face, the theme that will emerge will be to accept, rather than be accepted by someone who takes different from what we are.

The game takes place on a level structure, for a total of three levels.
Each of them is divided into six sections, in which the player is tested with different puzzles.
